# EasyConnect_Web

## Overview
- In abstract the goal of our device is to improve the flow of information and enhance the networking experience for both end users and event hosts. We aim to accomplish this by developing a smart wristband that exchanges information between users via a simple handshake and duals as an event entry solution.

## Information Flow
- 

## Potential Business Model
- **Rental model**
  - Event hosts can rent our smart wristbands and support infrastructure for a small percentage of the purchase price, somewhere between 5-10% seems reasonable.
- **Purchase model**
  - Event hosts can purchase our smart wristbands and support infrastructure, allowing them to be reused/reprogrammed as desired.

## Hardware

### Microcontroller
- [Tiny Matter-Native Board for Smart Home - XIAO ESP32C6](https://www.seeedstudio.com/XIAO-ESP32C6-p-5854.html)
- Chosen due to networking capabilities and small form factor, specifically the ability to create thread networks.

### Thread Border Router
- [Amazon.com: ESP Thread Border Router/Zigbee Gateway Board](https://www.amazon.com/ESP-Thread-Border-Router-Gateway/dp/B0BN6NP21L)
- Chosen due to compatibility with the microcontroller to create thread networks. Ample information online about how to connect this gateway with the ESP32C6.

### Inertial Measurement Unit
- [Adafruit BNO055 + BMP280 BFF Add-On for QT Py](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4754)
- Chosen due to small form factor and performance capabilities of the BN055 chip which produces high quality data and will allow for simplified gesture recognition.

### Display
- [Adafruit 1.14 240x135 Color TFT Display + MicroSD Card Breakout [ST7789] : ID 4383](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4383)
- Chosen due to it being a high pixel density color display in small form factor with a built in microsd card reader which will allow images to be downloaded without using the built in MCU memory which is extremely limited.

### NFC tag
- [Adafruit ST25DV16K I2C RFID EEPROM Breakout - STEMMA QT / Qwiic : ID 4701](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4701)
- Chosen due to the ability to reprogram the tag over I2C which allows the MCU to reprogram the tag dynamically and it can be read using modern smartphones.

### SD Card
- [Amazon.com: PNY 32GB Elite Class 10 U1 microSDHC Flash Memory Card - 100MB/s, Class 10, U1, Full HD, UHS-I, Micro SD (Pack of 3)](https://www.amazon.com/PNY-Elite-microSDHC-Memory-3-Pack/dp/B07YXJM282)
- Chosen due to the price point, cheapest Micro SD cards I could find from a reputable company.

### External Antenna
- [Amazon.com: Adafruit 2.4GHz Mini Flexible WiFi Antenna with UFL Connector - 100mm](https://www.amazon.com/Adafruit-2-4GHz-Flexible-Antenna-Connector/dp/B00LSYRLK8)
- Chosen due to easy compatibility with the MCU using the UFL connector and the antenna being flexible which will allow it to be stored in the strap of the wristband.

### Battery
- [Amazon.com: KBT 3.7V 500mAh Li-Polymer Battery: 503035 Lipo Rechargeable Lithium-ion Replacement Batteries with PH 1.25 JST Connector, PH2.0/2.54 JST Connector for Replacement](https://www.amazon.com/KBT-503035-Rechargeable-Lithium-ion-Replacement/dp/B0CKGLWRSP)
- Chosen due to it having similar dimensions to the display which is the largest breakout board on the device while providing sufficient capacity. The Apple Watch Ultra series batteries have similar capacities (around 500mAh).

### Wristband Material
- [TPU 85A / TPU 90A | Bambu Lab USA Store (TPU 90A- White)](https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/tpu-85a-tpu-90a)
- Chosen due to it being the most flexible material that I'm able to print with using my 3D printer that isn't a crazy color. Planned to be used as the strap material.
- [PC FR | Bambu Lab USA Store (Black)](https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/pc-fr)
- Chosen due to its flame resistant properties and ability to withstand heat without deformation. Planned to be used as electronic housing.
